to access the memory location of a variable, we use & operator
to access the memory location of say a variable x, we will write &x

%p is used to format address

to find where a variable is stored in memory using the & operator

once we get the address, we need a pointer variable
sample : int *address_of_x = &x;

to read the value of a pointer
sample: int value_stored = * address_of_x; 

& and * are opposites
& => provides address of a variable
* => provides value of an address

pointers are sometimes called references, the * operator is said to 
dereference a pointer


to change the value of an address, you do something like this:
*address_of_x = 99;
take note of the syntax above.
